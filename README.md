# RespiratoryDiseaseDetectionandReportGeneration
For this project, we have chosen to diagnose among fourteen respiratory ailments, namely, Atelectasis, Consolidation, Infiltration, Pneumothorax, Edema, Emphysema, Fibrosis, Hernia, Mass, Nodule, Cardiomegaly, Pleural thickening, Pneumonia, and Effusion, the data sets of which are available in ample amounts that would help us in training our model to achieve high accuracy in classifying the diseases. Our model intends to take a chest X-Ray image as an input, detect traits common to the following fourteen respiratory ailments, classify correctly and generate the corresponding diagnosis report. For this purpose, we will make use of the VGG-19 model, and using Graph Based Convolutional Network, we will generate the corresponding report
